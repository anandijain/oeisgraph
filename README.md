# oeisgraph

this repo is for analyzing the reference graph of all sequences in the OEIS.

there will be a few methodologies.
the first is just creating directed edges between all A-codes found thru a regex

the second will be looking at the crossref section (%Y)

the third will be removing "Sequence in Context" and "Adjacent sequences" from the crossref
